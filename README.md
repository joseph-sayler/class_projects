# Class Projects

This repository holds various projects I have worked on in the classroom.

#### Date project
The Date project is a java class with various methods to create and manipulate objects that contain calendar data. This was originally a project for a computer science class I took through Bellevue College.

To test the class, I created a  sample test case that lists all of the class methods and their output.

To do:
* add javadocs to the class
* work on static method daysTo (it doesn't seem to work for me anymore)
* create some type of interface (tui or gui)
